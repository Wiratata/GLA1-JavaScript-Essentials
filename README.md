OBJECTIVE 
In this Graded Learning Activity, you will explore some of JavaScript essentials: variables, 
functions, HTML manipulation, CSS manipulation, and input validation. Learning how to explore 
the documentation and understanding how these methods work is an essential part of this 
activity. Learning how to declare the correct variables and proper variable naming is also a part 
of this activity.

Every step is to be completed using JavaScript code only: 
1. Display your full name inside of an H1 element. Use a variable to store your name. 
2. Make your name center-aligned and change its color to #AA0061. 
3. Append two input elements and one button. When the button is clicked, display the 
sum of the two input elements on the page. Do not use alert or console. Your result 
must be displayed on the page. 
4. Validate the values in the input fields. The input should only accept numbers. If the 
input is not a number, set the input boxâ€™s borders to color #D40404. 
5. Add style to at least two other elements in your page.
